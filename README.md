# GCD_in-Assembly
This Program calculate the GCD of Two Numbers in Assembly Language  


# Description

Write a recursive implementation of Euclidâ€™s algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor
(GCD) of two integers. Descriptions of this algorithm are available in algebra books and on
the Web. Write a main program that calls your GCD procedure five times, using the following
pairs of integers: (5,20), (24,18), (11,7), (432,226), (26,13). After each procedure call, store the
GCD in the memory.
Follow the Microsoft R x64 calling convention.
